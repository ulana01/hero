            <h2>About</h2>
            <p>Hello, I'm Madina Yerdenova, and I'm a lawyer passionate about guiding the next generation on their career path. 
                Obtaining my skills at Big4 companies (Deloitte 2018-2021 and KPMG 2022-2023), I've had the privilege of advising a diverse range of clients on complex matters spanning corporate law, intellectual property rights, civil and tax dispute resolution. My experience at these organizations provided me with invaluable insights into global best practices and industry standards, enriching my understanding of the corporate landscape.
                Additionally, my time at the Tech Hub of the Astana International Financial Centre (2021-2022) further fueled my passion for exploring the intersection of law and technology, empowering me to offer innovative solutions to emerging challenges in the digital age. With a background rooted in providing legal counsel to both established corporations and new startups, I bring a wealth of experience to the table.
                Now, I'm eager to pay it forward by offering mentorship and guidance to aspiring students and young specialists embarking on their professional paths. I'm here to provide support, share knowledge, and help cultivate the next generation.
                Let's start your career journey together!.</p>
